## Fishery

### Catch

Catch estimates are a combination of foreign observer data, joint venture catch data, and NMFS Regional Office blend data. 
Catch estimates for dusky rockfish are available from 1977 to `r year` (Table 12-\@ref(tab:catch), Figure 12-\@ref(fig:fcatch)) and range from 17 t in 1986 to 4,535 t in 1999. 
Reported catches prior to 1988 are likely underestimated as these catches occurred during the end of the joint venture years and prior to accurate catch accounting of the newly formed domestic fishery.

### Age and Size Composition

Observers aboard fishing vessels and at onshore processing facilities have collected samples for evaluating size and age compositions of the commercial catch of dusky rockfish. 
Ages were determined using the break-and-burn method [@Chilton1982]. 
Aging has been completed for the 2000--`r year-2` samples (Table 12-\@ref(tab:fac)). 
Table 12-\@ref(tab:fac) depicts the raw age distribution of the samples without further analysis to estimate a more comprehensive age composition. 
However, the samples were randomly collected from fish in over 100 hauls that had large catches of dusky rockfish, therefore the raw distribution is likely representative of the true age composition of the fishery. 
Fish ranged in age from 4 to 66 years. 
The mode has decreased recently from 14-15 years old in 2012-2016 to 11-13 years old in 2018 and 2020.
Several large and relatively steady year classes are evident through the time series including 1986, 1992, 1995, and 1999 ref (Figure 12-\@ref(fig:ffac)).

Length frequency data for dusky rockfish in the commercial fishery are available for the years 1991-`r year-1` but are only used in the model when age compositions are not expected to be available for that year (Table 12-\@ref(tab:fsc). 
These data are the raw length frequencies for all dusky rockfish measured by observers in a given year. 
Generally, these lengths were taken from hauls in which dusky rockfish were either the target or a dominant species, and they provide an indication of the trend in size composition for the fishery. 
The relatively small sample sizes in 1995 and 1996 should be treated with caution as all years, though they are included in these analyses. 
Size of fish taken by the fishery generally appears to generally be consistent with a mode centered on 45 cm.
Fish smaller than 40 cm are seen in moderate numbers in certain years (1991-92, 1997, and 2017-2021, Figure 12-\@ref(fig:ffsc)), but it is unknown if this is an artifact of observer sampling patterns, or if it shows true influxes of younger fish or a decrease in older fish.

## Survey

### Biomass Estimates from Trawl Surveys

Comprehensive trawl surveys were conducted on a triennial basis in the GOA from 1984--1999, and biennially since 2001 (Table 12-\@ref(tab:vast)).
Dusky rockfish were separated into “light” and “dark” varieties in surveys since 1996 and starting in 2004 labeled as dusky and dark rockfish. 
Each of these surveys has shown that dusky rockfish (light dusky) overwhelmingly predominate and that dark rockfish (dark dusky) are caught in small quantities. 
Presumably, the dusky rockfish biomass in surveys previous to 1996 was predominately light dusky rockfish.
The 1984 and 1987 surveys were completed using different vessels, net design, and sampling protocols so have been excluded from this assessment. 

The spatial distribution of the catches of dusky rockfish in the `r year-5`, `r year-3`, and `r year-1` surveys are shown in Figure 12-\@ref(fig:fcpue). 
The magnitude of catch varies greatly with several large tows typically occurring in each survey. 
It is unknown whether these fluctuations indicate true changes in abundance, temporal changes in the availability of dusky rockfish to the survey gear, or are an artifact of the imprecision of the survey for this species. 
In the `r year-1` survey, catches of dusky rockfish were highest in the central GOA, with substantially lower catches observed in the western and eastern GOA. 

Trawl survey abundance presented here uses geostatistical model-based estimates (VAST model) with a lognormal error distribution (Table 12-\@ref(tab:vast); Figure 12-\@ref(fig:fsurvey)), though trawl survey biomass from a design-based estimator is also presented per SSC request (Table 12-\@ref(tab:db)).

### Age and Size Composition 

#### Age 

Gulf-wide age composition data for dusky rockfish are available for the 1990 through `r year-1` trawl surveys (Table 12-\@ref(tab:sac)). 
The mode of the age data has recently decreased age-15 in 2015 and to age-10/11  in 2017-2021. 
These age data indicate that strong recruitment is infrequent. 
For each survey, ages were determined using the “break-and-burn” method of aging otoliths, and a Gulf-wide age-length key was developed. 
The key was then used to estimate age composition of the dusky rockfish population in the GOA. 
The 1986 year class appeared strong in the 1993, 1996, and perhaps the 1999 surveys (Figure 12-\@ref(fig:fsac)).
Because rockfish are difficult to age, especially as the fish grow older, one possibility is that some of the fish aged-12 in 1999 were actually age 13 (members of the 1986 year class), which would agree more with the 1993 and 1996 age results. 
Little recruitment occurred in the years following until the 1992 and 1995 year classes appeared. 
The only prominent year class until the most recent survey was the 1998 year class, which had the highest proportion of ages sampled in the 2013 survey. 
In 2019, there appears to be some evidence for a potentially stronger year classes in approximately 2010, though this is less clear in the 2021 survey data.

#### Size

Gulf-wide survey size compositions are available for 1990-2021 (Table 12-\@ref(tab:ssc); Figure 12-\@ref(fig:fssc)). 
Survey size compositions suggest that strong recruitment of dusky rockfish is a relatively infrequent event, as only three surveys, 1993, 2001, 2003, and potentially 2009 showed evidence of substantial recruitment. 
Mean population length increased from 39.4 cm in 1987 to 43.1 cm in 1990. 
In 1993, however, a large number of small fish (~27-35 cm long) appeared which formed a sizeable percentage of the population, and this recruitment decreased the mean length to 38.3 cm. 
In the 1996 and 1999 surveys, the length frequency distribution was similar to that of 1990, with very few small fish, and both years had a mean population length of 43.9 cm. 
The 2001 size composition, although not directly comparable to previous years because the Eastern GOA was not sampled, shows modest recruitment of fish <40 cm. 
In 2003, a distinct mode of fish is seen at ~30 cm that suggests relatively strong recruitment may have occurred, and this is supported again in 2005 with a distinct mode starting at ~37 cm. 
Sample sizes have remained stable varying from 1,000 to 3,000 lengths collected per year.
Survey length compositions are used in estimating the length-age conversion matrix and in estimating the population age composition, but are not used as an additional compositional time series because survey ages are available from those same years.

### Maturity Data

Maturity-at-age data for female dusky rockfish maturity are obtained by combining data collected on female dusky rockfish from Lunsford (pers. comm. July 1997) and [@Chilton2010].
More recently @Conrath2019 has reported skip spawning in dusky rockfish, the impacts of which are not currently incorporated into the assessment.
